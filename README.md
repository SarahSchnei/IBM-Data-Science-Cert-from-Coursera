Sarah's Analysis of NYC Neighborhoods and the Number of Coffeeshops they House

What makes a good location for a coffeeshop? Is it the foot traffic potential, proximity to colleges or art culture, afluency of the neighborhood, or a combination? Today I want to examine the coffeeshops in the diverse New York City, looking at all of these questions with the lense of data to increase clarity and uncover insights. This analysis of neighborhoods in New York will be helpful to those looking to open their own coffeeshops, and perhaps demystify what makes a good location.

Data

In this analysis, the data used will be sourced from Foursquare, where we can look at locations and ratings of coffeeshops and their surrounding neighborhoods, as well as a report from CityRealty, who reported on average home selling prices in New York in 2018, allowing us to evaluate the affluence per neighborhood.

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page provided economic data per bourough from 2017

Methodology

In this report I queried Foursquare's API to see the location of cofeeshops in each of New York's 5 boroughs, and clustered those results to visualize where there the lesser populated areas in the city were. I also loaded data on the median income in each bourough is.

Results

In conclusion, the best place to set up a coffeeshop in New York today would in the Financial District part of the Manhatten Bourough, which holds the highest median income, and also has the smallest and most sparse coffeeshop population. A high end coffeeshop that quickly services financial workers on their morning commutes would succeed in this area.
